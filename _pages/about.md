# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #


I am a senior R&D engineer with Huawei Technologies AB, Sweden. From Oct. 2021 to April. 2022, I was the experienced algorithm developer in Ericsson AB, Sweden. From Aug. 2020 to Sep. 2021, I was a Postdocal Fellow at Haifa University, Haifa, Israel, under the supervision of Prof. [Roee Diamant](https://sites.google.com/edu.haifa.ac.il/anl/personnel?authuser=0). I receveid my Ph.D from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. [Fengzhong Qu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jimqufz). From Nov. 2018 to Nov. 2019, I was the research asistant at Lehigh University, PA, United States, under the supervision of Prof. [Yahong Rosa Zheng](https://www.lehigh.edu/~yrz218/). 

My research focuses on how to use Bayesian theory and AI to improve the capability of 
signal detection and estimation process that will determine the KPI of wireless \& 
underwater acoustic (UWA)
communications. Recently, I made efforts in the exploration of Bayesian-driven 
deep learning methodologies to standardize the 5.5G's architecture from baseband 
receiver design to radio digital pre-distortion (DPD). I'm also self-motivated
to pioneer the potential technologies that will contribute to 6G.
